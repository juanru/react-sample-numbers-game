Simple react game with following requirements:
* The user needs to solve a randomly generated Math puzzle to win the game
* There is a goal number that need to be matched based on addition and subtraction operations
* The user needs to select 4 numbers to be able to resolve the puzzle
* Selected numbers can be unselected as long as the "check" button is not pressed
* The game starts with 4 lives and by failed results, the lives will be discounted
* If there are no lives remaining the game is over
